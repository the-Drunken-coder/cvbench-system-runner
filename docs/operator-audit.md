# Operator observability and auditability

CVBench has one control plane: the Cloudflare Worker, Static Assets, and D1. Submitted code is never executed there. A GitHub-hosted Linux runner leases one job and invokes the existing Docker-isolated engine.

## Trust boundaries

- Public submission keys can enqueue jobs; public reads expose only bounded summaries.
- `OPERATOR_READ_API_KEYS` is separate from both submission and runner credentials. `OPERATOR_ADJUDICATOR_CREDENTIALS` is a secret JSON mapping of one credential to one normalized stable actor identity; duplicate normalized actors/tokens, reserved generic identities, and any cross-scope bearer overlap fail closed, routes compare tokens in constant time, and bearer values never leave memory.
- `RUNNER_TOKEN` can lease and callback but cannot read operator routes. Lease tokens are one-use, expiring, and stored only as digests.
- The runner strips control-plane/GitHub secrets from the benchmark subprocess. Docker has no network, no Docker socket, and only the progressive input socket mount.
- Raw JSONL, stderr, overlay videos, and other large evidence are not uploaded by the public repository. D1 receives bounded report JSON and the operator API returns bounded samples, integrity hashes, and explicit `raw_evidence_available: false`.
- Model output is untrusted text. It is JSON data in the API and is inserted with `textContent` in the console; it is never evaluated as JavaScript, HTML, shell, or an agent instruction.

## Stable operator routes

| Route | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/operator/jobs?status=running&model=...&limit=25&cursor=...` | queue/running/completed list and polling; follow `next_cursor` for the next page |
| `GET /api/v1/operator/jobs/:id` | admin detail, raw bounded report, provenance, checks, score, failures |
| `GET /api/v1/operator/jobs/:id/audit` | deterministic flags and fairness/adjudication shape |
| `GET /api/v1/operator/jobs/:id/evidence` | sampled overlays-equivalent frame records and evidence references |
| `GET /api/v1/operator/jobs/:id/notes` | operator verdict trail |
| `POST /api/v1/operator/jobs/:id/notes` | append `{verdict,note}` with actor attribution, without modifying scores; requires adjudicator credential |

All flags contain `review_aid_only: true`; none is an automatic disqualification. The evidence packet distinguishes observed and predicted support, states such as coasting/reacquired, matching decisions, occlusion/reacquisition, false-track segments, external collector latency, resource/isolation evidence, and reproducibility fingerprints. The evaluator marks unavailable telemetry as `not_observed` instead of silently treating it as a violation.

Fairness evidence keeps denominator eligibility, `matched`, and positive `counted_toward_score` credit separate. Coverage denominators include every on-screen, detection-eligible row, including eligible unmatched misses; continuity accepts any gated support for that eligible row; localization counts observed gated geometry, including an ineligible row when that component's metric includes it; acquisition requires an eligible observed confirmed/reacquired match. Each sampled row carries the per-component denominator booleans, credit booleans, and an explicit miss reason.

## Baseline proof

The local D1 lifecycle (`npm run test:d1`) creates an immutable baseline submission, exercises idempotent replay, leases it, posts a scored report, and reads the result. The in-memory API tests additionally prove operator-token separation, admin detail, audit retrieval, and note/verdict persistence. Legacy D1 rows receive `legacy-operator` attribution and no result hash, so duplicate-result status is `unknown` until a new callback records comparison data. The real baseline engine command is:

```bash
cvbench run --benchmark benchmarks/persistent-target-tracking.yaml \
  --system systems/example-good-local.yaml --output /tmp/cvbench-operator-baseline
```

Its `report.json` contains bounded `audit_evidence` and declares the Worker-authoritative `sha256(cvbench.canonical-json/v1)` hash contract; after callback, D1/API persist and return the computed hash plus `raw_evidence_available: false`. Raw ground-truth/model-output files remain outside the control-plane result and are not uploaded by the public workflow.
